  - >0.8: Excellent fit
  - 0.6-0.8: Good fit
  - 0.4-0.6: Moderate fit
  - <0.4: Poor fit

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average prediction error in original units
- **MAPE**: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (lower is better)
  - <10%: Highly accurate
  - 10-20%: Good accuracy
  - 20-50%: Moderate accuracy
  - >50%: Poor accuracy

#### For Classification (Category Predictions)

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions
  - >90%: Excellent
  - 80-90%: Good
  - 70-80%: Moderate
  - <70%: Poor

### Forecast Interpretation

- **Forecast Line**: Predicted future values
- **Confidence Interval**: Range of likely outcomes
- **Trend**: Overall direction (increasing, decreasing, stable)

## Understanding Performance Metrics

The application provides several key metrics to help you understand how accurate your forecasting model is. Here's what each metric means and how to interpret them:

### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
**What it measures**: The average difference between predicted and actual values
- **Units**: Same units as your data (e.g., dollars, units, percentages)
- **Interpretation**: Lower is better (closer to 0)
- **Example**: MAE of 15.83 means predictions are typically off by about 15.83 units
- **Business meaning**: Shows the typical size of prediction errors

### RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
**What it measures**: How well the model explains the variability in your data
- **Scale**: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
- **Interpretation**:
  - 0.95+ = Excellent (explains 95%+ of data variance)
  - 0.80-0.94 = Good 
  - 0.60-0.79 = Fair
  - <0.60 = Poor
- **Business meaning**: Higher RÂ² means the model captures patterns well

### MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
**What it measures**: Prediction accuracy as a percentage of actual values
- **Scale**: Percentage (lower is better)
- **Industry benchmarks**:
  - <5% = Excellent accuracy
  - 5-10% = Good accuracy
  - 10-20% = Acceptable accuracy
  - >20% = Poor accuracy (needs improvement)
- **Example**: 1.29% means predictions are typically 1.29% off from actual values
- **Business meaning**: Easy to understand relative accuracy

### Automatic Performance Assessment

The application automatically interprets your model's performance:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Excellent Performance** (MAPE < 10% + RÂ² > 0.8): "Your forecasts are highly reliable!"
- ðŸŸ¡ **Good Performance** (MAPE < 20% + RÂ² > 0.6): "Your forecasts are reasonably accurate."
- ðŸ”´ **Needs Improvement**: "Consider using more data or different model parameters."

### What These Numbers Mean for Your Business

**Lower MAE** = More precise predictions (smaller typical errors)
**Higher RÂ²** = Model captures your data patterns well
**Lower MAPE** = More accurate relative predictions

### Example Interpretation

```
Sample Results:
Mean Absolute Error: 15.8253
â†’ "Predictions typically differ by 15.83 units from actual values"

RÂ² Score: 0.9479
â†’ "Model explains 94.79% of data variance - Excellent!"

MAPE: 1.29%
â†’ "Predictions are typically 1.29% off - Excellent accuracy"

Overall Assessment: ðŸŸ¢ Excellent Model Performance
```

### Using Metrics for Decision Making

1. **Trust Level**: Higher RÂ² and lower MAPE = more trustworthy forecasts
2. **Business Planning**: Use MAE to understand typical forecast uncertainty
3. **Model Comparison**: Compare metrics when testing different approaches
4. **Risk Assessment**: Lower accuracy metrics suggest higher forecast risk

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "No date column detected"
**Problem**: The application can't find a date column
**Solution**: 
- Ensure your date column has a clear name (Date, Time, Period)
- Check that dates are in a recognizable format
- Verify the column contains actual dates, not text

#### "No numeric KPI columns detected"
**Problem**: No numeric data found for forecasting
**Solution**:
- Ensure KPI columns contain only numbers
- Remove any text or special characters from numeric columns
- Check that columns aren't formatted as text in Excel

#### "Insufficient data points"
**Problem**: Not enough historical data for reliable forecasting
**Solution**:
- Provide at least 30 data points
- Consider aggregating daily data to weekly or monthly
- Combine multiple smaller datasets if appropriate

#### "Model training failed"
**Problem**: Unable to train any forecasting model
**Solution**:
- Check for data quality issues
- Ensure sufficient variation in your KPI values
- Remove any duplicate or erroneous data points

#### Performance Issues
**Problem**: Application runs slowly or times out
**Solution**:
- Reduce file size (consider sampling large datasets)
- Use fewer forecast periods
- Ensure stable internet connection

### Data Quality Checklist

Before uploading, verify:
- [ ] File is in Excel format (.xlsx or .xls)
- [ ] Date column is clearly labeled and formatted
- [ ] KPI columns contain only numeric values
- [ ] At least 30 data points are available
- [ ] Missing values are less than 20% of data
- [ ] No obvious data entry errors

## Best Practices

### Data Preparation

1. **Clean your data first**: Remove obvious errors before uploading
2. **Use consistent formatting**: Same date format throughout
3. **Label columns clearly**: Use descriptive names
4. **Include context**: More historical data generally improves accuracy

### Forecasting Guidelines

1. **Start with shorter horizons**: Begin with 30-day forecasts
2. **Consider seasonality**: Include full seasonal cycles in historical data
3. **Validate results**: Compare predictions with business knowledge
4. **Update regularly**: Retrain models with new data

### Interpreting Results

1. **Focus on trends**: Don't over-interpret specific values
2. **Use confidence intervals**: Consider the range, not just the point estimate
3. **Combine with domain knowledge**: Supplement predictions with business insights
4. **Monitor model performance**: Track how well predictions match reality

### Business Applications

1. **Budget Planning**: Use forecasts for financial planning
2. **Resource Allocation**: Plan staffing and inventory based on predictions
3. **Goal Setting**: Set realistic targets based on trends
4. **Risk Management**: Use confidence intervals to assess uncertainty

### Limitations

1. **Historical patterns**: Models assume future will resemble the past
2. **External factors**: Cannot predict impact of new events or changes
3. **Data quality**: Results are only as good as input data
4. **Uncertainty**: All forecasts have inherent uncertainty
